# Airline_data_analysis
Quick analysis of airline data using PowerBI, Excel and Sql

If you want to play around with the visulaization: https://www.novypro.com/project/indian-airline--market-share-analysis-

This was a quick analysis done on a airline dataset shared in the daily learning channel from the codebasics discord. 

It was a fun challenge and wanted to use Sql, PowerBI and Excel to do some preliminary analysis

ðŸŽ† I quickly took the dataset, created an excel pivot chart and a graph to visualize the market share by year

ðŸŽ† The data was shared as a csv flat file, then I uploaded it to sql server and wrote a query to get airline marketshare by year and saved the query result into a new table

ðŸŽ† Then I opened PowerBI desktop and quickly imported my query result and the original dataset and created some neat dashboards which involved ribbon charts

ðŸŽ†Quickly published my work to novypro and github

The more we practice, the better we become.

Things I learned: 
Ribbon charts are effective in analysing market share over time

Observtions:
From the visualization we can clearly see Indigo is the major player in indian airline space.
Vistara is steadily gaining marketshare over the last 2 years
Jet airways has been out of business since 2019
