# Airline_data_analysis
Quick analysis of airline data using PowerBI, Excel and Sql

If you want to play around with the visulaization: https://www.novypro.com/project/indian-airline--market-share-analysis-

This was a quick analysis done on a airline dataset shared in the daily learning channel from the codebasics discord. 

It was a fun challenge and I wanted to use Sql, PowerBI and Excel to do some preliminary analysis

🎆 I quickly took the dataset, created an excel pivot chart and a graph to visualize the market share by year

🎆 The data was shared as a csv flat file, then I uploaded it to sql server and wrote a query to get airline marketshare by year and saved the query result into a new table

🎆 Then I opened PowerBI desktop and swiftly imported my query result and the original dataset and created some neat dashboards which involved ribbon charts

🎆Finally published my work to novypro and github

The more we practice, the better we become.

Things I learned: 
Ribbon charts are effective in analysing market share over time

Observtions:
From the visualization we can clearly see Indigo is the major player in indian airline space.
Vistara is steadily gaining marketshare over the last 2 years
Jet airways has been out of business since 2019
